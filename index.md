The Philippines Disaster Information System (PHIL-DIS) was developed to establish a database for disasters in the Philippines that explicitly includes spatial information. PHIL-DIS aims to gather data on disaster events from official government reports, map disaster events and their patterns in the country, produce a web-based platform that has a capacity to display textual, tabular, visual and spatial  information on disaster events, and formulate a template that can be used to systematically gather data on disaster events.

## Status
PHIL-DIS currently has information on: **350** disaster events from **1897** to **2017**.
